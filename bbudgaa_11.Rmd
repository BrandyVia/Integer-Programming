Let's define the variables first
x1 is number of workers started on Sunday
x2 is number of workers started on Monday
x3 is number of workers started on Tuesday
x4 is number of workers started on Wednesday
x5 is number of workers started on Thursday
x6 is number of workers started on Friday
x7 is number of workers started on Saturday

```{r}
library(lpSolveAPI)
x <- read.lp("schedule.lp")
x
solve(x)
#Total Cost
get.objective(x)
#Number of workers started on Sun-Sat
get.variables(x)
#Number of workers required on Sun-Sat
get.constraints(x)
```
